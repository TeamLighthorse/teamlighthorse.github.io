This post will walk you through what's new in C# 9.0

### Top-Level Statements

- Top-Level statements remove the unnecessary boilerplate from applications.
- You can now write statements at the top level after the  `usings` and before the classes.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <kbd>
            <img src="/assets/img/topLevel1.png">
        </kbd>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
        <kbd>
            <img src="/assets/img/topLevel2.png">
        </kbd>
    </div>
</div>

### Init Only Setters

- In order for object initializers and immutability to work together, you need a version of the setter that only works during initialization. This is called the init only setter.
- Now you can create init accessors instead of set accessors for properties.
- You can use property initializer syntax to set values in creation expressions, but those are readonly once construction has completed. 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
    <p>Here we can declare init only setters in our weather observation structure (or any class or struct)</p>
        <kbd>
            <img src="/assets/img/initSetter1.png">
        </kbd>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
    <p>We can use property initializer syntax to set he values, while still preserving the immutability</p>
        <kbd>
            <img src="/assets/img/initSetter2.png">
        </kbd>
    </div>
</div>

### Record Types

- A record is a class that has been enhanced to have value like behavior.
- Only records can inherit from records.
- Records are immutable by default.
- They make it easy to create immutable reference types in .NET.

### When do you use a record, class or struct?

- If you have data structures where things point to other things you need a reference type such as a record. Records solve the problem that I want to be value oriented by default but structs don't because you can't have data structures with structs pointing to structs.
- If you have allocated reference types and hierarchies that describe your data model like inheritance, then you'll need to use classes.
- If you're unsure whether to use a class vs a record, ask yourself; Are you describing values and working with immutability? Use a record. Or are you describing object oriented programming with mutable state that's incapsulated? Then use a class.

### Patterns

- When we want to match against a type, you had to include a discard in C# 8, now this is unnecessary in C# 9.
- For example:
