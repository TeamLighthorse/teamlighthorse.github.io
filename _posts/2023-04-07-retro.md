__QA Issue Count:__ 23*

**Includes QA Issues created since 2/26/2023

<!--more-->

- e2e tests failing caused a new, impactful bug to get into production
  - Team believes that's partly due to Azure DevOps spam
  - **Action**
    - We will remove default reviewers from each branch on each repo
    - If you are reviewing a PR, add yourself as a reviewer
      - This will reduce spam and also indicate who is performing the code review
    - Staging tester should be responsible for ensuring e2e tests are passing before approving an item to go into Production
    - Person who discovers e2e test failure should immediately create a work item and place it at the top of the "Approved" column
- Team wants to ensure we finish updating Angular Material. Currently using deprecated components
	- **Action**:
		- We will add items to the board for completing the upgrade
