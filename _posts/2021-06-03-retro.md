4. New work item tag OR card color for items that have the iteration value of "Nucleus" 
5. Plan an outing to include intern

### Synopsis
The team met for their latest retrospective on Tuesday, March 9th. We addressed various concerns and came up with a list of action items to address those concerns. Primary amoung them were concerns about customer reported urgent bugs. It was determined that we need to define a response time from levels 1-3 depending on how important or how quickly the bug needs to be fixed. The team decided that we need to be more clear in our communication and who is working on the item.

We also acknowledged that it would be a good idea if we had documentation for our local development in each repo as this would be useful for new developers as well as a reference for the team.

The team noticed when testing items in staging it was harder to test with mock data. Therefore, we decided to come up with a plan to restore the production database into staging. This way it will be easier to test these items with more realistic data.

**Takeaways:**
- More coverage w/ integration tests
	- smoke test
	- get item on board for refining
		- what do you want/need
	- more ownership from the team in the e2e stuff
- Post-mortem for Production bugs
- Add tag or change card color if work item lacks effort
- Add tag or change card color if work item has "Nucleus" for iteration value
- Outing w/ Luke
	- Top Golf
	- Real Golf
- Maybe an IT dept family outing / cookout
