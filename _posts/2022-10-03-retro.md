Latest Team Lighthorse retrospective.

__QA Issue Count:__ 49*

**Includes QA Issues created since 9/1/2022 - half of which were probably Ryan's*

<!--more-->

- Review went well
  - Team believes that's due to the planning that goes into it
  - **Action**
    - Will seek to avoid showing Dev or QA environments during reviews due to volatility of those environments.  
- Freight Plan Timeline, Spotlight, TL/LTL Direct & Multi-Stop TL dialogs, Load Template Wizard all look & function really well
- Lost track of Shipment Spotlight refactor work items
  - **Action**
    - Will recreate those items and get them back on the board and prioritized
- Team is working through figuring out how to best prototype / mock up more complex UI/UXs that we don't immediately have ideas for
	- **Action**:
		- We will do mob sessions for the next "complex" UI/UX we need to create.
- Freight Planning
  - Front end & back end are inconsistent in terms of language, naming, terms
  - **Action**
    - Will create work tems to refactor the client-side naming, terms, and possibly any inconsistencies in the data model
- Clarified the Code Review "Done" column (vs Doing)
  - Done "sub-column" means the work item has been code reviewed, comments have been resolved, and PR either is Approved or can be Appproved & Completed. Basically, it means the item is g2g
- Actually do the Friday 15 min. sharing sessions where we share what we've learned
- Need to not lose track of work items for "breadcombs" UX and for enhancing e2e test coverage to include AddressBook.
