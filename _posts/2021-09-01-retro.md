2. Jon will schedule quick OData demo for team.
3. Must have passing test plan created to submit a PR.
4. Update team documentation to reflect test plan changes.
5. Get internal item on the board for persisting Kubernetes pod logs (ELK stack).

__QA Issue Count:__ 16

### Synopsis
The Cloud Team met for another retrospective on Wednesday, September 1st. 

The QA Issue count was lower than the previous iteration, but still higher than we'd like at 16. To address this, the team has decided to augment our process by requiring a test plan prior to submitting a pull request. Then, during the code review meeting, we will execute the test plan during the demo portion, and verify that it is passing. We believe this, in combination with testing in development and our existing process, will drastically lower our QA Issue Count and allow us to get things through our pipeline quicker and with less rework.

We also discussed our first production outage. We had a node go down on our production Kubernetes cluster, and we did some introspection on the steps that we took while troubleshooting and attempting to diagnose this issue. Ultimately, we decided that it would be nice if we had a way to quickly and easily recreate an environment using Azure DevOps Pipelines. We identified the main obstacle to accomplishing this as handling DNS. We would need a way to automatically switch our DNS to point to the newly created AKS cluster. This would prove to be difficult since our DNS is handled in-house. Jon will be working with our Network Team to find a solution to this issue.

Along with automating AKS cluster creation, we also decided that we need a better way to preserve and analyze our Kubernetes pod logs. Application Insights is nice and all, but it's definitely not easy to use, and doesn't always tell the complete story of what happened when we have issues occur. Microsoft Azure offers a "Log Analytics" solution for container logs, but we have turned that feature off due to the high cost. So, we decided that we should look at possibly implementing an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) stack in our AKS environment. We're going to put an Internal Project on our board to investigate that.

All-in-all the team is pleased with the process, and pleased with how things are going. We did have some log jams occur in our "Testing" column on our Kanban board, but we believe that this was due to the increase in QA Issues, and we also believe that the aforementioned changes to our devleopment process should sufficiently address this issue.

So, all is well. Great job, and on to the next.
