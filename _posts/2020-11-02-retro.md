### Synopsis
The team met for their latest retrospective on Monday, November 2nd. In general, the team feels very good about it's team process and communication. Specially, the collaboration on on the Quick Rate mockups was praised. Nicole and Dave did a great job working together to produce a great looking mockup, and the implementation is looking really great as well. We do however, think it's important to continue emphasising "developer-on-developer" communication.

It was brought up however, that the line between mockup and implementation, in terms of Storybook, is getting pretty blurry. We need to focus on drawing a hard line between when a mockup is "completed", and when the implementation is to begin. Also, mocking data inside components hosted in storybook is a topic of contention. In the end, it was decided that our existing team process _should_ accommodate issues like these. We should treat mockup PBIs like any other PBI, internal work, bug, or tech debt item. In other words, our team process dictates that we have a short planning session before pulling a new PBI into the "In Development" column. These planning sessions are when things like mock data, and implementation lines should be discussed and decided upon.

The team noticed that the recent balance between frontend and backend work has been tilted too heavily towards the backend. This is likely due to the need to accommodate a new customer's API integration needs. But in the end, it was determined that the backlog wasn't solely the responsibility of the Product Owner. The entire team needs to keep eyes on the backlog and when it gets too heavily weighted toward front or back end. Also, the team members need to be reviewing the backlog pre-refinement.

As Storybook has emerged as our style guide and component development tool of choice, we need to evolve and enhance our usage of it to account for things like documentation. As such, previously we decided to try out a plugin that uses mdx (markdown) format to display documentation-related data on another tab inside storybook. However, with mdx stories, the team doesn't get any compile time safety. This could lead to regression-style bugs whenever components are updated. The team has decided that we need to sort of merge the TypeScript stories with the mdx stories. This should give us the best of both worlds so-to-speak.

Next up was code reviews. Our code review sessions have been universally praised as being super useful. A lot of great tips and feedback have been given during these sessions. I brought up how I'm very pleased with the participation level of everyone involved in each one of these sessions, even when they last 2+ hours. Everyone has done really well in terms of staying dialed in throughout each code review. Everyone also agrees that they're too long. We are going to try and do little things to speed them up or avoid people being involved in them when it's unnecessary.

We are going to continue to focus more on work item decomposition. Smaller work items should lead to smaller reviews. We will also look for files that we can skip during the review. Nicole brought up html files as being skip-worthy. She notes that there's hardly ever anything interesting going on in these files. Everyone agrees that at this point, it's not necessarily wise to make any procedural changes to our code reviews as they are still very helpful. They're just very lengthy.

Hotfixes are causing issues with our team measurements. Metrics like cycle time are being affected. We have PowerShells that run as part of our Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines that attempt to manipulate work items on our Kanban board. We add things like "building" or "deployed to QA" tags to our work items as well as move them to the appropriate column once certain tasks are completed. It looks like these PowerShell scripts are not excluding work items that have already been completed. So the result is, whenever we apply a hotfix, Azure DevOps adds a TON of work items to the PRs submitted for the hotfix. So these work items go back to in progress and are then completed again. This screws up our measurements of how long it takes us to complete items.

Jon brought up that our shared kernel nuget packages have never progressed beyond their "beta" phase. He suggests that we have a code review for the entire kernel, and once complete, slap a 1.0.0 tag on it. We also need a more rigorous CI/CD pipeline. Currently we're just pushing to develop and a build pipeline will push it to Azure Artifacts.

I suggested that we be more aggressive in finishing our refactor of our monolith into microservices. Specifically, the "Shipments" area of the application needs to be factored out into a microservice because it's becoming quite the pain point in the application. Rating was also brought up. The team determined that we need to have PBIs for each "microedit" inside of Shipment Spotlight. These PBIs will represent work that will move the updating of a shipment to a microservice API call. The microservice will then event each of the changes out through EventGrid for other schemas to subscribe to and make the appropriate changes. We will likely keep the "shipments" schema inside the monolith as a read model, and then subscribe to shipment events published by the shipments microservice.

Jon brought up the Azure DevOps outage that occurred during this past iteration. It was decided that we need to look into on-premises backups in case we find ourselves in a situation where we can't deploy code for any significant amount of time. We are going to look into utilizing an onprem DevOps agent or perhaps using Azure DevOps Server as a backup to the cloud version. We will also review the Lighthouse SLAs to figure out what our tolerance is.

It was also decided that I write up the blog post immediately following the retrospective. This was because our last retro blog post and action items fell through the proverbial "cracks". I will also create work items for the action items defined below.
