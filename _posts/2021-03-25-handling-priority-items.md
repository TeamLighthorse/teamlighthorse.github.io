The team met on Thursday, March 25th, to discuss the handling of high-priority work items submitted by customers. We determined that for the most part, our process is fine as is. We did however, determine that it's important to balance the need to "turn off" Teams for distraction purposes as well as ensure SOMEONE "hops" on an issue ASAP.

### Run Down
We determined that when you set your Teams status to "Do Not Disturb", you will still get toast notifications (in addition to emails) when "Urgent" messages come into group chat. So whereas we previously said it was ok to close Teams periodically for concentration purposes, we now say that it is our team's policy to leave Teams open and simply set your status to dnd if you're trying to eliminate distractions.

We also discussed having the initial developer responding to the issue be the "point of contact" for the item for communication purposes. This person will answer status inquiries as well as handing off of said item if need arises.

**Changes to Team Process**
- Team members are expected to have Teams open throughout the "normal" work day (M-F, 8-5).
  - If a team member needs to reduce distractions, they are to set their Teams status to "Do Not Disturb"
- If a team member is working on a high priority item, but needs to step away for whatever reason, they are to hand their item off to someone else.
- Only post new QA items in team channel
- If a team member discovers a bug...
  - but questions the severity, message product owner
  - otherwise discuss in refinement and/or stand-up
- Azure DevOps "Urgent" swim lane will continue to be used for items that need immediate attention. Non-immediate bugs will be placed on the board in whichever order the product owner deems appropriate.
  - Next item up: top of the "Approved" column

**High-Priority Flow**
1. Product owner creates new bug item in the "Urgent" swim lane, in the "Approved" column.
2. Product owner sends a new "Urgent" Teams message to the "Urgent Issues" group chat.
3. A development team member is then expected to acknowledge the message and begin investigation.
4. This team member should then update the team on what they think the issue is, and approx. time to completion.
  - This person will be responsible for providing updates on the issue.
