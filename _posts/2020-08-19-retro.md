### Takeaways
 - Team had 19 QA issues:
   - 3 from internal projects
   - 5 from bugs
   - 11 from PBIs
   - As is the Way of the Horse, we will attempt to improve on these numbers
 - We will tighten the communication loop between stakeholders in Kelley Logistics 
   (Ron & Zack) and the team when forecasting for the next quarter. The desire is 
   to prevent previously-refined items from becoming stale in the scope of the work
   and where they fall in the feature food chain. The month prior to the beginning
   of the next quarter is a critical period for understanding expections for that
   quarter.
 - We are too often providing an effort of "Smedium" to PBIs because we feel the PBI 
   in question falls betwen a Small (2) and a Medium (8)
 - Introduce new features with the minimum set of properties that would qualify it
   as the MVP (minimum viable product) and then bolt on extra features as subsequent 
   PBIs associated with the feature at hand.

### [Action Items](https://dflcloud.visualstudio.com/Nucleus/_workitems/edit/4431)
 - Add a "Smedium" T-shirt size for scoring effort in-between Small and Medium
 - Retrospective meetings will now occur every 2 weeks regardless of whether a 
   feature review takes place. Retro meetings will occur in-person when a review
   does take place and will be remote otherwise.
