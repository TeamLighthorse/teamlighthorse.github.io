### Action Items
1. Have Jon lead a walkthrough on Lighthouse OIDC flow.
2. Schedule mob session on breaking up "Nucleus" repo.
3. Board changes:
   * Remove user story field from PBIs.
   * Rename user story field to description, keep "additional details".
   * Use the user story as a tool when distilling info and discovering new concepts.
   * Remove Ready to Merge column
     * Merge the DoD / DoR on the Testing and Ready to Merge columns before removing.
4. Enforce test plan on each work item, even if test plan says "just do the bug item's repro steps".

***# of QA issues*: 11**

### Synopsis
The team met for their latest retrospective on Monday, December 14th. We addressed various concerns and came up with a list of action items to address those concerns. Primary amoung them were concerns about long running builds that fail intermittently due to Angular tests. It was determined that we need to pay attention to error and warning messages during build, and focus on addressing the design of the intermittently failing tests. We also decided that we should prioritize the internal work item for splitting the Nucleus repo into separate, back end and front end repositories. We decided to call the front end "Lighthouse" and keep the back end "Nucleus". We believe that splitting the repos will result in shorter build times. So we determined that if we do this in conjunction with addressing the intermittently failing tests, that should address the issue.

We also acknowledged that we tend to prolong the daily stand-up unnecessarily. It was brought up that we don't want to lose the knowledge sharing that often occurs during these prolonged stand-ups. So we decided to double-down on the "offline" aspect of the stand-up. We will stick to answering the 3 questions, and any additional conversation will be taken "offline", so that any team member that needs to remove themselves from the stand-up can do so.

The team asked Direton and Ryan to help enforce this by serving as quasi-scrum masters since we do not employ one.

The "Log Jam" on our work item board was also brought up as a concern, but it was determined that the action items that we came up with should address this issue in conjunction with continuing to prioritize work item decomposition.

**Concerns:**
- Front end (Angular) tests
  - We need to take a look at how we're running tasks; locally, PR, and during CI. We need to catch things sooner.
- Stand-up duration too long
  - Direton / Ryan will enforce asking / answering the "3 questions".
    - What have you learned since yesterday?
    - What will you be working on today?
    - Are there any impediments?
- Work Item Board Log Jam
  - Focus on splitting front/back end repos
    - Once done should speed up, then we can focus on optimizing individual builds.
