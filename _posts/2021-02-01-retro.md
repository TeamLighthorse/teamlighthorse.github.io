### Action Items
1. Utilize "filler" tag for work items that can be worked on without refining. They will be trivial and self-explanatory, so won't require any additional discussion or acceptance criteria, and will default to small t-shirt size.
2. Create work item template in Azure DevOps that will automatically create and add the "Create Test Plan" task.
3. Update Azure DevOps notification settings to only email the team on build failures, and will email individuals when items they are tagged on are updated.
4. Get internal item on the board for retrospecting with CodaBears about API onboarding
   * Trying to find areas of improvement like adding a "services" dropdown on the API gateway SwaggerUI page.
5. Get meeting scheduled to discuss moving forward with the style guide.

### Synopsis
<img src="/assets/img/all_killer_no_filler.jpg" style="float: right;" />
The team met for their latest retrospective on Monday, February 1st. We addressed various concerns and came up with a list of action items to address those concerns. The chief concerns seemed to center around Azure DevOps. We would like to do a better job of tagging PRs with the appropriate work items, so that our board automation that runs during CI/CD works properly. We've had numorous cases of PBIs not being tagged on the PR and therefore, not being placed in the correct column after CI runs. We're also not consistently tagging work items with the correct repository name. This helps us manage testing and knowing when we need to hold off completing a pull request due to columns being at their WIP limit.

Team members also complained about the amount of email notifications they're currently getting from Azure DevOps. We decided that we only want notified of build failures and when items we are tagged on get updated.

We also encountered some issues when trying to start a new component that depends on a new API. When work needs to be started concurrently, the team needs to collaborate beforehand to iron out data contracts.

The team discussed it's usage of Storybook, and determined that the original intent was to use Storybook to get a style guide going. Thus far, that has not happened, so we will get a meeting scheduled to discuss moving forward with this initiative.

Moving forward, we will also be utlizing the "filler" (as in all filler, no killer) tag for items that are light, super easy, and do not require any additional conversation. The team members will be free to pull these items into the "In Development" column whenever they need work but nothing is ready in terms of the "killer". We created a new Azure DevOps query that should give you back all the pending "filler" items. The team will use this query to determine which "filler" is up next.

**Takeaways:**
- Need to do a better job tagging PRs with work items.
- Need to do a better job tagging work items with repo names.
- Attempt to hash out contracts up front when both front end and back end work is required.
- Standardize mockup submission
  - Team decided to attach to the work item (vs paste in comments).
- When creating a new component, we need to collaborate at the onset to scaffold the new component. Perhaps this should happen during planning via paired or mob programming session.
